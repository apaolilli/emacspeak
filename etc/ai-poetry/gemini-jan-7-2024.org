## Ellama: write a poem on emacspeak, the speech-enabled extension to Emacs

## Gemini:
In the realm of code, where silence reigns, Emacspeak emerges,
breaking the chains, A voice of guidance, a beacon of light, For those
who seek knowledge, day and night.

With synthesized tones, it whispers sweet, Guiding fingers, making
tasks complete, Commands and text, it reads aloud, Dispelling shadows,
casting off the shroud.

For those who cannot see the screen's embrace, Emacspeak opens wide
the gates of grace, A symphony of words, a guiding hand, Empowering
minds, across the land.

Its voice, like a gentle breeze, caresses, As it weaves its magic,
like silken tresses, Keystrokes dance, like raindrops in the air,
Emacspeak listens, with a tender care.

It reads and writes, with eloquence and ease, A tireless companion,
bringing thoughts to please, A bridge between the mind and the
machine, Unleashing creativity, thoughts unseen.

With Emacspeak's guidance, worlds unfold, As lines of code transform
into tales untold, It speaks of errors, warnings, and success, A
faithful comrade, never to digress.

For those who navigate the digital sphere, With vision impaired,
Emacspeak is near, A beacon of hope, a guiding light, Illuminating the
path, through the darkest night.

In the vast tapestry of software's art, Emacspeak stands tall, a
masterpiece apart, A testament to ingenuity and grace, Empowering
minds, in every time and space.

So let us raise our voices, in chorus we sing, To Emacspeak, the voice
that makes Emacs sing, For in its embrace, all can create, A world of
words, where dreams take flight, elate.
