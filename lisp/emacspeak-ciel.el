;;; Commentary:
;; Package ciel provides vim's "copy inside" and "clear inside" commands.
;; Emacspeak binds these commands to <Super i> and <Super o>.
;; This module speech-enables ciel.

;;; Code:

;;   Required modules:

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl-lib))
(cl-declaim  (optimize  (safety 0) (speed 3)))
(require 'emacspeak-preamble)

;;;  Advice Interactive Commands:

(defadvice ciel-ci (after emacspeak pre act comp)
  "Speech-enabled by emacspeak."
  (when (ems-interactive-p)
    (dtk-speak (car  kill-ring))
    (emacspeak-icon 'delete-object)))

(defadvice ciel-co (after emacspeak pre act comp)
  "Speech-enabled by emacspeak."
  (when (ems-interactive-p)
    (emacspeak-icon 'mark-object)
    (dtk-speak (format "Copied: %s " (car  kill-ring)))))

(provide 'emacspeak-ciel)
