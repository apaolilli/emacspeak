EMACSPEAK --A SPEECH OUTPUT SUBSYSTEM FOR EMACS                             
X-URL:
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.emacs/browse_thread/thread/552b2dea2783f7bd/8f35edccc3bedfc7?lnk=gst&q=emacspeak&rnum=19#8f35edccc3bedfc7

* Announcing Emacspeak, a full-fledged speech output interface to Emacs. *  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


Emacspeak is the first full-fledged speech output system that
will allow someone who cannot see to work directly on a UNIX
system. (Until now, the only option available to visually
impaired users has been to use a talking PC as a terminal.)

Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs. Once you start emacs with
emacspeak loaded, you get spoken feedback for everything you
do. Your mileage will vary depending on how well you can use
Emacs.There is nothing that you cannot do inside Emacs:-) I
currently use Emacspeak at work on my DECALPHA workstation
running Digital UNIX. I also use Emacspeak as the only speech
output system on my laptop running Linux. Emacspeak currently
supports the new Dectalk Express speech synthesizer, as well as
older versions of the Dectalk e.g. the MultiVoice. On the
DECALPHA, you can use it with the software Dectalk. (If you have
a DECALPHA and also have software Dectalk installed at your site,
please get in touch with me and I'll give you some additional
code that emacspeak needs to work with the software Dectalk.)
You need GNU FSF Emacs 19 (version 19.23 or later) and TCLX 7.3B
(Extended TCL) to run Emacspeak. See the Emacspeak distribution
for additional details. 

Available from the following sites: FTP:
ftp://crl.dec.com/pub/digital/emacspeak/emacspeak.tar.gz WWW:
http://www.research.digital.com/CRL/personal/raman/emacspeak/emacspea...
Emacspeak comes with full source level documentation. There is an
online info manual as well, but this is still incomplete.  EMACS
SUBSYSTEMS Emacspeak currently has extensions for many popular
Emacs subsystems including: o W3: A full-fledged W3 browser
[available by FTP]. Emacspeak implements a voice-lock mode
analogous to Emacs' font-locking that allows it to speak WWW
hotlinks using different ~voice personalities~.  o GNUS: The
Emacs news reader. Emacspeak provides a fluent extension to gnus
that allows you to listen to Usenet news without taking your
fingers off the four arrow keys.  o VM: The Emacs VM mail
reader. Emacspeak works with VM to present email messages using
different voices; Parts of a message that are cited from a
previous message are ~voicified~to produce effective aural
presentations.  o Eterm: The Emacs 19 terminal emulator. (This
will be part of Emacs 19.29). You can obtain a beta copy of eterm
[via anonymous FTP]. I have used Emacspeak and Eterm to
successfully login to work from my laptop and interface with
running applications on my office workstation (including running
Emacs sessions!).  Emacspeak also works well with Emacs addons
like AUCTEX for editing TeX documents, the Emacs Calculator (CALC
--a symbolic algebra system) etc.  Emacspeak works fluently with
all Emacs addons; writing an extension makes its use even more
pleasurable. If you would like to write an Emacspeak addon for
your favorite package please get in touch with me so we do not
end up duplicating work.  SUPPORT FOR EMACSPEAK Emacspeak comes
as is, please see the accompanying [Copyright] notice. See the
[README]file for details about this release and how to install
Emacspeak on your system.  I work on Emacspeak in my spare time,
and may not be able to answer questions on Emacspeak
immediately. If you do download and use Emacspeak, please
subscribe to the mailing list ~emacsp...@crl.dec.com~by sending a
message to ~ emacspeak-requ...@crl.dec.com~.
